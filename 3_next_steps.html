            <p>For the rest of the semester, we will learn the basics of object programming. This is new for me in
                JavasScript so I'm curious as to how it goes. We will most likely learn about classes, etc.</p>
            <p>The first course after this one, on the next semester is that of Java programming. I will try to RPL it
                by taking the exam at the end of the semester. Afterwards, we will have Front end, Back end and Server
                programming.</p>
            <p>I would like to take later on more courses on different languages, like Python or C++/C#. I don't think
                those are offered in Haaga-Helia, but Metropolia has some and they can be taken online. They have as
                well programming Apps for both Android and iOS, which should be really useful for our working life, if
                we would like to do anything related to that.</p>
