            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Visibility of system status</p>
                    <p>I have tried to include the title of the page before the content to summarize what the current
                        page the user is in is about. On top of that, the navigation buttons also indicate what is on
                        the next and previous page, not just "previous" and "next". The website is too basic to need
                        further indicators on status.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Match between system and the real world</p>
                    <p>I tried to be descriptive and natural with the pages' titles, which are very important since it's
                        what users rely on to navigate the website. This is quite difficult though. Same goes for the
                        button to return to the index, which could be "Home" (what I decided on) or "Main". Could
                        possibly be even "index", but this one is definitely quite technical.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">User control and freedom</p>
                    <p>For this is why I chose to have the "back to home" link on every page, for example. I think it
                        easies up the navigation a lot, so that users don't need to browse through all the pages if they
                        don't want to.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Consistency and standards</p>
                    <p>I tried to inspire myself on real websites about the placement of objects and the way the work
                        (that footer, however, has given me more headaches than satisfactions!). My first idea or
                        principle was that I wanted my website to be consistent, even when using different layouts or
                        displaying information in different ways, such as having a list, or text alone or with pictures.
                        I also tried to keep the interface to a minimum as to not get too confusing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Error prevention</p>
                    <p>Again, with the website not having much interactivity (or just basic menus) there isn't a large
                        room for error. That said, for example alt-text has been added to the images in case they have a
                        problem loading.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Recognition rather than recall</p>
                    <p>For this, again, I tried to make navigation front and center, especially on mobile, so that
                        people didn't need to search the page for the links.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Flexibility and efficiency of use</p>
                    <p>My website is too simple to require any real advanced features for improved efficiency.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Aesthetic and minimalist design</p>
                    <p>Although beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I did try to make my website simple and uniform as
                        to look nice without being flashy, overbearing or confusing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</p>
                    <p>Again, not much interactivity to require true error handling situations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Help and documentation</p>
                    <p>Although the website is simple, I think I could add a lengthier description on the main page
                        about what the sections will be about (very briefly!) to facilitate even more the navigation.
