                    <p class="items">Writing to the web page</p>
                    <p>This part is a bit tricky, as it is more related to HTML
                        than JavaScript, so even if we manage fine with the
                        basics of programming, remembering the exact lines to
                        load data from the page and writing to it is something
                        we need to learn by heart.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Conditions</p>
                    <p>This was my mistake on the exam. Conditions are tricky
                        because the program might work even if they're not set
                        up properly. Troubleshooting can be tricky and we need to
                        think about the structures we make, not simply following the
                        debugger.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Iterating: Different options</p>
                    <p>We have two ways (for now) to make loops, for and while.
                        They work similarly, but have some differences in the
                        way they are started and how the stepping is counted.
                        If mixing them or an exercise requires you to use a
                        particuar one pay special attention not to confuse the
                        way they work!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="items">Arrays</p>
                    <p>One thing which has been difficult for me is to always
                        keep in mind that arrays are not created simply empty
                        but "undefined", which limits what you can do with them
                        until items are added.</p>
